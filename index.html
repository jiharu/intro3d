## Course description 

This course introduces 3D modeling and animation as tools for artistic expression. Areas of study include modeling, texture mapping, rendering, lighting design and camera placement. Students learn to integrate sequences with film, video and audio. The history of 3-D graphics, computer animation and contemporary examples are presented and discussed. Students with credit in INTM-2B33 may not take this course for credit.

The 3D modeling & animation class is designed for students to learn both practical and theoretical knowledge in constructing and managing 3-dimensional modeling and animation art. It is a highly interdisciplinary and complex subject of artistic expression and technological understanding, therefore needing a creative open mindset from students. Throughout the class, there will be five to six assignments and two projects to help students build problem-solving abilities toward the subject in an incremental way. 

Each class consists of one hour of lecture and two hours of lab practice to accomplish theoretical and practical approaches. The main software used in the class is Autodesk Maya, which has very strong support for modeling as well as other related stages of the production pipeline.

The level of the course covers beginner to intermediate. Evaluation will be mainly via major projects and minor assignments taking a creative approach to expressive 3D modeling, texturing, and animation.

## Course objectives

-  To build a framework of skills and vocabulary to create and modify 3D data.   
-  To understand the fundamental components and their position in the production pipeline of 3D modeling & animation art-making.   
-  To appreciate the interdisciplinary research attitudes of art and technology (via computer graphics).   
-  To invest independent and artistic expression along with problem solving processes during construction.   
-  To develop awareness of current 3D modeling & animation practices through diverse examples of animation, films, video games, virtual worlds, 3D printing, and so on.  

It is expected that the majority of the assignments will be completed outside of class time. 
		
### Students will learn

Understanding 3D computer graphics / Maya interface and structure / Maya NURBS, polygon, subdivision modeling / shading including texturing / UV texture mapping / deformers & shape blending / digital cinematography / lighting & rendering / global illumination / ambient occlusion shading & depth of field / key-frame animation / path animation / camera & lighting animation 

## Course format

This class is highly practice based. One-third of the class will be lecture-based, showing theory and practice using presentation media and demonstration (33%). The other two-thirds will be supervised students’ hands-on practice (66%). 

-  Please be patient to repeat practice exercises until you feel familiar with the logic & structure of the 3D software interface, pipeline, processes, and vocabularies, since complexities can easily overwhelm. If you have any question or difficulty in following, don’t hesitate to ask to the instructor.   
-  Develop your unique preference as a maker/producer among a variety of 3D modeling and animation techniques.   
-  If you have high fluency using 3D software, then investigate near future trends and develop your artistic style.   
-  When you research examples of 3D artworks, try to avoid popular mass productions such as Pixar’s or DreamWorks’; instead find a specific modeler and investigate his/her portfolio as an independent artist.   
-  Explore many usages of 3D modeling or animation in different areas such as entertainment, education, medical, manufacture, and so on.   
-  Sharing information is recommended to accelerate the speed of progress, unless it interrupts other students’ concentration. Questions and discussions are encouraged during class time.   

### Supply
Students will be required to supply laptop, three button mouse, and headphones (to follow web tutorials) in the class. Please also bring a notebook or small sketchbook and pencils to sketch and collect ideas.  

## Grade breakdown
- Mid-term project: Still-life group project (30%)  
- Final-term project: Free-theme individual project (30%)   	
- Assignments (30%) 
- Participation (10%)  

### Project description:  
More details regarding projects and assignments will be announced in class.

- **Mid-term still-life group project:** based on a chosen reference of still life (painting or a photograph) with a scene construction, reconstruct via 3D modeling. Applying proper shaders with textures and cinematographic set-up including camera, lights, and shadows. Details will be announced in class. (30%)  
- **Final-term free-theme individual project:** 15 seconds completed animation along with one HD render image. More details will be announced in class. (30%)  
- **Assignments:** simple hands-on practices designed to help students’ progress following each 3D modeling & animation subtopic. Completion in time and proper targeting to the subject are the two evaluation criteria. (30%) 
- **Participation:** regular attendance and the student’s participation in research, making, listening, sharing, and participating in class activities. Also, it is expected that students will show a commitment to completing all projects and assignments with creative & aesthetic solutions based consistent work habits both in class time and outside of class time. - [Attendance policies at OCAD U](http://www.ocadu.ca/AssetFactory.aspx?did=519&_ga=2.35199463.715965410.1526300798-73291238.1525873950)

## Evaluation criteria
- Quality of the work produced; with the balance of the student’s artistic expression & sensitivity as well as technical understanding, with integration of techniques and subject.  
- Ability to solve problems into the process of making.  
- The progress and engagement of the student in their research, and their curiosity and motivation to learn and achieve.  
- The degree and details to which students can set challenges for her or himself.  
- Commitment (includes attendance, participation, completing work on time)
