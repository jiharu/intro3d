# Maya Texturing
## Goal
- Understanding the processes of UV texturing in Maya.
- Understanding Maya's 3D Paint Tool along with Photoshop.

Although the Hypershade window provides numerous ways to prepare materials, several important techniques outside this window are important to know. Preparing proper **UVs** for any model is a critical step in the texturing process. Using the **3D Paint tool** is an efficient way to prepare custom bitmaps. Maya's support for the **Photoshop PSD format** allows the use of layers. At the same time, the proper use of bump and displacement maps can add realism to a render.

## UV mapping
>UV stands for the horizontal (U) and vertical (V) coordinates of the 2D coordinate map space that is applied to a 3D object.

UVs are 2D representations of a 3D object. There can be a problem with wrapping a 2D image (a texture) around a 3D object. UV mapping helps with this problem: UVs are directly related to vertices on a polygon and NURBS, but the UVs cannot be manipulated in 3D space; they are tied to a 2D coordinate plane and edited in a **UV editor**.

> UVs are like a “where” — they are a coordinate system across the surface of polygons (think latitude and longitude across a globe). 
> Understanding what UVs are and being able to manipulate them is incredibly powerful and allows any image to define the surface of a 3D form. ***Unfortunately, this power to manipulate UV is not a trivial task and can be very counterintuitive.***

----------
## UV Texture editor
3D software uses u- and v-coordinates to determine how textures should be applied to 3D objects. **UV mapping** refers to the process of determining these coordinates for polygon objects. **UV layout** is a term that refers to the 2D configuration of the UVs on a surface. In the **UV Texture Editor**, u-coordinates are plotted along the horizontal axis, and v-coordinates are plotted along the vertical axis. **UV maps** act as a guide for the placement of images. 

**NURBS surfaces have implicit UVs; this means that the coordinates are built into the parameterization of the surface. UV texture coordinates do not have to be created for NURBS surfaces; only polygon and subdivision surfaces require mapped UVs.**

## Maya standard shaders and Mental Ray materials
The most often used standard shaders are Blinn, Lambert, Phong, Phong E, and Anisotropic. You can use any of these shaders when rendering with Maya and mental ray.

![mm01](img/maya/shading/texturing/my.png)

The below shaders will work only when rendering with mental ray.

![mm02](img/maya/shading/texturing/mr.png) 

## Bump, displacement map
- [Bump And Displacement Map: Overview, up to 1:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mdR2imNeZI) 
- [To adjust the displacement value](http://animation-ua.com/en/school-animation/studying-3d-animation/165-control-displacement-maps-in-maya-displacement-mapping)  


## Layered texture vs. Layered shader
There are two ways to layer textures in Maya: using the Layered Shader with the texture compositing flag (see Layered shaders), or with the Layered Texture Node. Though the workflow for using the Layered Texture node is similar to the Layered Shader, using the Layered Texture node is recommended because you can set many blend modes.

## Double-sided shaded surfaces
Double-sided shading lets you shade a surface with one material on one side and a different material on the other side. This is the only way you can apply more than one material to a NURBS surface. You use both the Condition and Sampler info utility to create this effect. 

- [Use a layered texture](http://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2016/ENU//?guid=GUID-45A50E53-E47A-44EB-8A66-9856A4AFDA17)

![sc01](img/maya/shading/texturing/double.png)

## Background surface
**Shadow catching:** You can render out shadows separately from everything else. This is important in many cases, for example, if you want to blur shadows. In a composition you can soften, blur, brighten or change the color of shadows to match whatever it is they are composited against.

## Practice B: Texturing a dice
### Goal
- To manipulate UV texture coordinate in the UV texture editor to apply texture properly.
- To edit a texture in Photoshop.

![dice](img/maya/shading/texturing/dice.jpg) 

![box](img/maya/shading/texturing/box.png)

- How to:
	- Create a box and apply a material.  
	- From the color in the attribute editor of the material, open it and click the file node. And from the file node, you can link to the chosen texture.
	- Push the hotkey '6' from the keyboard to see the texture in the work space. 
	- Choose UV editing from under Workspace menu.
	- You can navigate this window in the same way as the viewport, and choose UVs or Shells, and  transform them. (With the right button of your mouse, you can choose the object's UV components)  

	![uv](img/maya/shading/texturing/uveditor.png)
	
	- Let's select UV shells (RMB) and apply Cut from UV Toolkit. Now you can move the individual shell.   
	- Now you can move, sew, and align UVs for the texture mapping.  
	
	![uv](img/maya/shading/texturing/uveditor01.png)

	- You can save a UV texture (UV Texture Editor // Image / UV Snapshot or Create PSD Network). Then you can open the texture in Photoshop and edit it. 

	![dice01](img/maya/shading/texturing/dice_snap.png)

________________________________
	
## Practice C: 3D painting texture 
**Goal:** creating 3D painted textures.  
**Command location:** Rendering // Texturing / 3D Paint Tool   

- Let's create 'color' and 'bump' textures using a brush and/or paint effect. 

![3dpaint02](img/maya/shading/texturing/3dpaint00.png)
![3dpaint02](img/maya/shading/texturing/3dpaint01.png)
![3dpaint03](img/maya/shading/texturing/3dpaint02.png)

### Using PSD network
1. Save UV texture (UV Editor // Image / UV Snapshot... )     
2. Create PSD Nexwork... (UV Editor // Image / Create PSD Network...) and Update PSD Network...	

________________________________
	
## Practice D: 3D Cut and Sew UV tool 
**Goal:** controlling UVs in the viewport for more efficiency.  
**Command location:** Modeling // UV / 3D Cut and Sew UV Tool   

The 3D Cut and Sew UV Tool allows you to create or stitch seams on UV shells right in the viewport, instead of through the UV Editor. For more information on cutting and sewing edges, see [Separate and attach UVs](http://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2018/ENU/?guid=GUID-578193DB-7EE7-4C60-A26F-9187DF8614A3).

## Lab practice E (optional): Eye texturing 
### Using textures and a projection utility

![eye01](img/maya/shading/texturing/eye.jpg)


- How to:	
 	![eye00](img/maya/shading/texturing/stensil00.png)
	- Create a NURBS sphere add isoparms (using Insert isoparms) to the iris area. 
	- Duplicate it and make a second one a little bit bigger. Put it into a layer.  
	- Shape the first one using Hulls to make the inner curve tino a iris. 
	- For a pupil, choose the pupil size isoparm and detach it. 
	- Delete the detached patch and create another sphere and make it small to fit to the pupil area and assign surface shader. 
	 	 
 	![eye02](img/maya/shading/texturing/stensil01.png)
 	- Assign a material from the color attribute, call the texture window and assign a projection utility.  
 	
 	![eye03](img/maya/shading/texturing/stensil02.png)
 	 - From the projection node, call the texture image from the image node and then do Interactive Placement + Fit to BBox.
 	- You will see the projection placement node from the work space which you can control.
 	
 	 ![eye04](img/maya/shading/texturing/stensil03.png)
 	 - Now you can change the material attributes to make right  for you. 

![eye01_01](img/maya/shading/texturing/eye.png)

- Slight differences in the textures can change the result a lot. Therefore, please go ahead to work on textures in Photoshop.

1. Using Blender version 2.68
- Download and install.
- to use Maya navigation interface:  
	- In the Blender interface, open File/User interface
	- Go to Input and set the preset to 'Maya', and the hotkey option to 'Maya', and save user settings.
- Import .obj modeling data.
- Choose the object and go to the edit mode (tab key). With edge mode, select the edge which will become UV seams later. (Shift + Alt + edge to choose continous edges)  
- Ctrl + E to open the window and choose 'Mark Seam'
- With face mode, select all faces and push U key to open UV texture window and 'Unwrap'. 
- You can check the result to open the UV Editing window. 
- If you like the result, export the obj for import into Maya. Now your object will have good UV textures.
![blender](img/lab/uv.png)  
- An UV unwrap example screenshot using the monkey primitive mesh.
- You can download the obj data [here](obj/monkey.obj) from the right button of a mouse do as Save Link As.
