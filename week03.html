# NURBS modeling
## Goal

- Understanding NURBS modeling: curves and surfaces.
- Being able to create NURBS geometry and to modify its properties.
_________________

# Surface modeling   

Using one of several geometry types, 3D artists can build surfaces, then push and pull points to change their shape.

# NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines)
[Maya help: NURBS overview](http://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2018/ENU//?guid=GUID-5EC05798-3F28-4AD2-8154-36BC444A4DC9)

## NURBS
**Non-uniform rational basis spline (NURBS)** is a mathematical model commonly used in computer graphics for generating and representing **curves** and **surfaces**. It offers good flexibility and precision for handling both analytic (surfaces defined by common mathematical formulas) and modeled shapes. NURBS are commonly used in computer-aided design (CAD), manufacturing (CAM), and engineering (CAE) and are part of numerous industry-wide standards.   
[Wikipedia: Non-uniform rational B-spline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_rational_B-spline)
		  
### In Maya	
NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) are one geometry type you can use to create 3D curves and surfaces in Maya. 
NURBS are useful for constructing many types of organic 3D forms because of the smooth and minimal nature of the curves they use to construct surfaces. NURBS surface types are widely used in the fields of animation, games, scientific visualization, and industrial design.

>Maya calls any NURBS curve simply a “curve.” In some menus, Maya will refer to a surface created from curves as a “surface” and sometimes as “NURBS,” such as in the 'Modify/Convert' menu. Although other 3D programs might have more than one type of spline technology, you should know that even though Maya sometimes drops the word “NURBS,” we are still dealing with this technology whenever we use “curves” and “surfaces” within Maya.

### New terminology 

	NURBS, CV (Control Vertex), EP (Edit Point), start of curve, curve direction,  
	curve degree, hull, span, knot spacing..

## NURBS Surface
The components of the NURBS surface are very similar to those of the NURBS curve. NURBS surfaces have CVs, hulls, and spans which define the shape of a four-sided surface. NURBS models, whether they are organic or industrial in nature, are generally made up of several adjoining four-sided patches. As with the NURBS curve, it is desirable to define surfaces with the fewest evenly spaced isoparms or CVs. The quality and type of curve will affect the characteristics of the surface.

## Create surfcace  
### Planar

### Extrude  
- You need two curves (profile and path) perpendicularly positioned.

## How to modify/edit components
- Using F8 key, Marking menu with right mouse button, or select icon from the menu.

## Lab practice A: General setting
### Tool settings (option box)
![tool](img/lab/toolbx.png) 

### Attribute Editor (ctrl + a)
![tool01](img/lab/atte.png) 

### History nodes (INPUTS nodes)
#### To delete:
![tool02](img/lab/history.png) 

### The cursor for the icon & Help line
- Get a description of/instructions for the action under the cursor. (Turn on/off at the Preference/help)
- To help you understand the operation of the tools, view the Help Line as you scroll through the menus.
	
![help](img/maya/nurbs/help.png)

## Curve Editing

### Editing CVs & EP
- To modify, use the F8 key, Marking menu with right mouse button, or select icon from the menu. 

![curve](img/lab/curves.png) 

### Detaching & attaching curves
- Splits a curve into two new curves. You need to choose **an edit point** from the marking menu.
(Curves / Detach)

![curve01](img/maya/nurbs/curve/detach.png)

- Joins NURBS curves together at their endpoints to form a new curve. You can select two or more curves for attaching.

**Proportion:** the ratio of one quantity to another, especially the ratio of a part compared to a whole. In a mathematical context, a proportion is the statement of equality between two ratios.
